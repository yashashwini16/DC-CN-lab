     COMMUNICATION NETWORK LABORATORY 

     Lab Experiments: 
   
    1.Learn to use commands like tcpdump, netstat, ifconfig, nslookup and traceroute. Capture ping and traceroute PDUs using a network protocol analyzer and examine.
    2.Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).	
    3.Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using bellman-ford algorithm.	
    4.Applications using TCP sockets like:
        a) Echo client and echo server
        b) Chat
        c) File Transfer	
    5 Simulation of DNS using UDP sockets.	
    6.Write a code for simulating ARP /RARP protocols.	
    7.Implementation of Stop and Wait Protocol and Sliding Window Protocol.	
    8.Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm.	
    9.Simulate the transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.	
    10.Simulate an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source / destination.	
    11.Simulate simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wireless LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets.	
    12.Implement three node point-to-point networks with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth, and find the number of packets dropped.
