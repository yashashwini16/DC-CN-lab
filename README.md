     COMMUNICATION NETWORK LABORATORY 

     Lab Experiments: 
   
    1	Learn to use commands like tcpdump, netstat, ifconfig, nslookup and traceroute. Capture ping and traceroute PDUs using a network protocol analyzer and examine.	L3
    2	Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).	L3
    3	Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using bellman-ford algorithm.	L3
    cc4	Applications using TCP sockets like:
  a) Echo client and echo server
  b) Chat
  c) File Transfer	L3
5 Simulation of DNS using UDP sockets.	L3
6	Write a code for simulating ARP /RARP protocols.	L3
7	Implementation of Stop and Wait Protocol and Sliding Window Protocol.	L3
8	Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm.	L3
9	Simulate the transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.	L3
10	Simulate an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source / destination.	L3
11	Simulate simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wireless LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets.	L3
12	Implement three node point-to-point networks with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth, and find the number of packets dropped.	L3
